## Common Issues & Solutions üîß

### Issue: "No wallet provider available"
**Solution**: Install Leather, Xverse, or Hiro wallet extension and refresh page

### Issue: "No sender address"
**Solution**: Disconnect and reconnect wallet, ensure you're on testnet

### Issue: "Insufficient STX balance"
**Solution**: Get testnet STX from faucet: https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet

### Issue: Transaction stuck in "pending"
**Solution**: Wait 30-60 seconds. Testnet can be slow. Check explorer for status.

### Issue: "makeStandardSTXPostCondition" error
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Already fixed! Updated to use new `Pc` API from @stacks/transactions v7

### Issue: Modal doesn't close
**Solution**: Refresh page. Modal should only be closeable when status is 'idle'

### Issue: Wallet shows wrong network
**Solution**: Open wallet extension settings and switch to Testnet

---

## Quick Test Script üöÄ

For fastest testing:

1. **Setup** (1 min):
   ```bash
   cd /project/workspace/Anthonyushie/Stackmate
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Wallet** (2 min):
   - Install Leather wallet
   - Get testnet STX from faucet
   - Connect wallet on localhost:5173

3. **Entry Test** (2 min):
   - Navigate to home
   - Click any puzzle "ENTER PUZZLE"
   - Accept terms
   - Confirm in wallet
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Verify redirect

**Total Time: ~5 minutes for complete flow**

---

## API Fix Verification ‚úÖ

The original error has been **FIXED**:

**Before:**
```typescript
import { makeStandardSTXPostCondition, FungibleConditionCode } from '@stacks/transactions';

const pc = makeStandardSTXPostCondition(
  senderAddress,
  FungibleConditionCode.Equal,
  entryAmount
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const pc = Pc.principal(senderAddress).willSendEq(entryAmount).ustx();
```

This uses the new fluent API from `@stacks/transactions` v7.2.0.

**API Breakdown:**
- `Pc.principal(address)` - Specifies the principal (address) creating the post condition
- `.willSendEq(amount)` - Sets condition code to "equal" with the specified amount
- `.ustx()` - Specifies this is for micro-STX (ŒºSTX) tokens

The resulting post condition object:
```typescript
{
  type: 'stx-postcondition',
  address: 'ST2QK4128H22NH4H8MD2AVP72M0Q72TKS48VB5469',
  condition: 'eq',
  amount: '1000000'
}
```

## Next Steps

After confirming the entry flow works:

1. **Test puzzle solving**: Submit solution and verify leaderboard
2. **Test claim prize**: Simulate winning and claiming
3. **Test edge cases**: Multiple entries, deadline expiry, etc.
4. **Load testing**: Multiple simultaneous entries
5. **Cross-wallet testing**: Test with all 3 wallet providers

Good luck! üéâ
