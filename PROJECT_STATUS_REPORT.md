# Stackmate Project Status Report

Generated: October 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY** ⚠️

The project has excellent architecture and design, but requires several fixes before deployment:
- ❌ **TypeScript Build Errors**: 45+ compilation errors blocking builds
- ❌ **Missing Environment Configuration**: No `.env.local` file for smart contract connection
- ⚠️ **Smart Contract**: Code is wired correctly but needs configuration
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Generally good (8/10) with minor issues
- ⚠️ **Dependencies**: Installed with 18 low severity vulnerabilities

---

## 1. Build Status ❌ FAILING

### TypeScript Compilation Errors (45 errors)

#### Critical Issues:

1. **Invalid Media Query Syntax** (SolvePuzzle.tsx:366)
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG - Inline styles don't support media queries
   '@media (min-width: 1024px)': { gridTemplateColumns: '2fr 1fr' }
   ```
   **Impact**: Build failure, responsive layout broken

2. **Missing Theme Properties** (Multiple files)
   - `colors.light` - doesn't exist (should be `colors.white`)
   - `colors.accent` - doesn't exist (should be `colors.accent1/2/3`)
   - Files affected: Leaderboard.tsx, MyWins.tsx, Profile.tsx, Puzzle.tsx, SolvePuzzle.tsx

3. **Type Mismatches**
   - ClaimPrizeModal prop type errors
   - NeoBadge doesn't accept `style` prop
   - Missing JSX namespace declaration

4. **Unused Imports** (26 warnings)
   - Various unused imports in multiple files
   - Not critical but affects code quality

### Action Required:
- Fix theme property references (colors.light → colors.white, colors.accent → colors.accent1)
- Remove invalid media query syntax
- Clean up unused imports
- Fix prop type mismatches

---

## 2. Smart Contract Integration ⚠️ WIRED BUT UNCONFIGURED

### Good News ✅
The smart contract integration is **properly wired**:
- ✅ Contract functions implemented (`enter-puzzle`, `submit-solution`, `claim-prize`)
- ✅ Read-only calls configured (puzzle info, leaderboard, user stats)
- ✅ Transaction polling and status tracking
- ✅ Multi-wallet support (Leather, Xverse, Hiro)
- ✅ Network switching (testnet/mainnet)
- ✅ Post-conditions for security

### Missing Configuration ❌
**Critical**: No `.env.local` file exists

**Required Setup:**
```env
VITE_CONTRACT_TESTNET=ST2QK4128H22NH4H8MD2AVP72M0Q72TKS48VB5469.puzzle-pool
VITE_CONTRACT_MAINNET=SPXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.puzzle-pool
```

**Contract Status:**
- Contract code exists: `/contract/puzzle-pool.clar` ✅
- Contract deployed: **UNKNOWN** - needs verification
- Testnet address: `ST2QK4128H22NH4H8MD2AVP72M0Q72TKS48VB5469.puzzle-pool` (from README)
- Mainnet address: Not specified

### Action Required:
1. Create `.env.local` file with contract addresses
2. Verify contract is deployed on testnet
3. Deploy contract to mainnet (if targeting production)
4. Test wallet connection with Leather/Xverse/Hiro

---

## 3. Mobile Responsiveness ✅ GOOD (8/10)

### Strengths ✅
- **Fluid Typography**: Excellent use of `clamp()` for responsive font sizing
- **Responsive Grids**: Proper use of `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints
- **Flexible Layouts**: Good use of flexbox with wrapping
- **Dynamic Sizing**: ChessPuzzleSolver uses ResizeObserver for board adaptation
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Container padding with `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`

### Issues Found ⚠️

1. **Invalid Media Query** (Critical)
   - SolvePuzzle.tsx line 366 has invalid inline media query syntax

2. **Fixed Grids on Mobile**
   - Some 2-3 column grids don't stack on very small screens (<400px)
   - Affected: EnterPuzzleModal, PuzzleCard stats grids

3. **Potential Text Overflow**
   - Large font sizes (56px, 72px) may overflow on small screens (<375px)
   - ClaimPrizeModal prize text needs testing

4. **Mixed Styling Approaches**
   - Some components use Tailwind, others use inline styles
   - Inconsistent responsive patterns

### Tested Breakpoints:
- ✅ Desktop (>1024px): Excellent
- ✅ Tablet (768-1024px): Good
- ✅ Mobile (375-768px): Good
- ⚠️ Small Mobile (<375px): Minor issues

### Action Required:
- Fix invalid media query in SolvePuzzle.tsx
- Test on devices <375px width
- Consider adding `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` to fixed grids

---

## 4. Dependencies Status ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES

### Installed Successfully ✅
- 633 packages installed
- All major dependencies present:
  - React 19 ✅
  - Vite ✅
  - TypeScript ✅
  - Stacks libraries ✅
  - Chess libraries ✅

### Security Warnings ⚠️
- **18 low severity vulnerabilities**
- Can be fixed with `npm audit fix`
- Not blocking but should be addressed before production

### Action Required:
- Run `npm audit fix` to patch vulnerabilities
- Consider updating to npm 11.6.1

---

## 5. Code Quality Assessment

### Architecture ✅ EXCELLENT
- Clean separation: components, hooks, lib, pages
- React Query for data fetching
- Zustand for state management
- Type-safe contract interactions

### Design System ✅ EXCELLENT
- Neo-brutal theme well-defined
- Reusable component library (neo/)
- Consistent color system
- Animation library with framer-motion

### Testing ⚠️ MISSING
- No test files found
- No test scripts in package.json
- No CI/CD configuration

### Documentation ✅ GOOD
- Comprehensive README
- Smart contract documented
- Setup instructions clear

## 6. What You Need to Do to Make It Work

### Immediate Actions (Required for Basic Functionality)

#### Step 1: Create Environment Configuration
```bash
cd /project/workspace/Anthonyushie/Stackmate
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
VITE_CONTRACT_TESTNET=ST2QK4128H22NH4H8MD2AVP72M0Q72TKS48VB5469.puzzle-pool
VITE_CONTRACT_MAINNET=SPXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.puzzle-pool
EOF
```

#### Step 2: Fix TypeScript Errors
**Priority Fixes:**
1. Fix `colors.light` → `colors.white` (7 occurrences)
2. Fix `colors.accent` → `colors.accent1` (9 occurrences)
3. Remove invalid media query in SolvePuzzle.tsx:366
4. Fix ClaimPrizeModal prop types
5. Remove unused imports

#### Step 3: Verify Contract Deployment
```bash
# Check if contract exists on testnet
curl https://api.testnet.hiro.so/v2/contracts/interface/ST2QK4128H22NH4H8MD2AVP72M0Q72TKS48VB5469/puzzle-pool
```

#### Step 4: Build and Test
```bash
npm run build  # Should succeed after fixes
npm run dev    # Start dev server
# Open http://localhost:5173 and test wallet connection
```

### Production Readiness (Recommended)

1. **Deploy Smart Contract to Mainnet**
   - Deploy `puzzle-pool.clar` to Stacks mainnet
   - Update `.env.local` with mainnet address

2. **Fix Security Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Add Testing**
   - Unit tests for critical functions
   - E2E tests for user flows
   - Contract interaction tests

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading routes
   - Image optimization

5. **Mobile Testing**
   - Test on real devices
   - Verify all breakpoints
   - Check text overflow on small screens
