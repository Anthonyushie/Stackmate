## Summary

Add React Query hooks for blockchain data fetching and wrap the app with QueryClientProvider.

## What’s included

1. `src/hooks/useBlockchain.ts`
   - `usePuzzleInfo(puzzleId)` — fetches puzzle info (read-only), refetch every 10s
   - `useLeaderboard(puzzleId)` — fetches leaderboard via Extended API and sorts by `solveTime`, refetch every 15s
   - `useUserStats(address)` — fetches user statistics (read-only), refetch every 30s; defaults to current wallet address if omitted
   - `useActivePuzzles()` — derives active puzzle ids using `get-puzzle-count` and `is-puzzle-active`, refetch every 20s
   - `useUserBalance(address)` — wraps STX balance fetch with 10s refetch; defaults to current wallet address if omitted
   - Proper query keys, enabled flags, error/idle/loading via React Query

2. `src/App.tsx`
   - Wraps the app in `QueryClientProvider` to enable hooks usage throughout the app

3. Already present in main from prior PRs
   - `@tanstack/react-query` dependency in `package.json`
   - Contract interaction layer used by the hooks

## Notes

- Env config required for read-only contract calls:
  - `VITE_CONTRACT_TESTNET=ST...puzzle-pool`
  - `VITE_CONTRACT_MAINNET=SP...puzzle-pool`
- Hooks automatically select current network and (if needed) default to the connected wallet address.

## Next steps

- Optionally add a dashboard UI to exercise these hooks (live puzzle info, leaderboard, user stats, active list, and balance).
- Add unit tests for read-only parsing and leaderboard extraction.
