## Summary

Add an interactive, Neo‑Brutalist chess puzzle solving component with animations, hints, and automatic validation.

## Component

- `src/components/ChessPuzzleSolver.tsx`
  - Board: `react-chessboard` + `chess.js`
  - Props: `puzzleId`, `fen`, `solution` (SAN array of the full line including opponent replies), `onSolve(stats)`
  - Features:
    - Timer that starts on load; “Hint” adds a 30s penalty
    - Auto‑play of opponent replies from `solution`
    - Move validation against `solution` (SAN exact match)
    - Visual feedback: green highlight (correct), red shake (wrong), hint highlight
    - Move history panel with progress indicator
    - Victory modal: “Puzzle Solved! Time: X:XX” and history snapshot
    - Custom Unicode piece theme, neo‑brutalist board styling, smooth transitions
    - Responsive (ResizeObserver) + dark mode friendly colors

## Design

- Neo‑Brutalist: thick borders, offset shadows, bold type, bright panels
- Animations via `framer-motion` (shake on wrong, spring modal on success)
- Mobile: responsive board width capped to fit container

## Usage

```tsx
<ChessPuzzleSolver
  puzzleId="b12"
  fen={puzzle.fen}
  solution={puzzle.solution}
  onSolve={(s) => console.log('Solved stats', s)}
/>
```

## Notes

- The hint button reveals the next player move path and applies a 30s penalty
- Validation is strict to keep alignment with the curated `solution` lines
- Promotion defaults to queen when required

## Next steps (optional)

- Confetti burst + sound on success
- Multi‑puzzle session mode with scoring (time + penalties)
- Accessibility option to read out SAN for the next move
