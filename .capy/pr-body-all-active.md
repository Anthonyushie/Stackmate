Title: Show all active puzzles on Home to surface newly created puzzles

Summary
- Add an "All Active Puzzles" section (newest first) so newly created puzzles are immediately visible and enterable
- Provide View and Enter actions per puzzle card; wired to existing Enter modal
- Keeps existing 3 difficulty spotlight cards intact

Why
Users who create a new puzzle (e.g., Expert) could not see/enter it from Home if an older active puzzle already existed for that difficulty. The UI previously picked the first active puzzle found per difficulty.

Changes
- Home.tsx: fetch active puzzle IDs and puzzle info, sort descending, render a grid of all active puzzles with per-puzzle CTA
- Fetch per-puzzle entry state for the connected wallet to reflect Entered/Enter button

Behavior
- New puzzles (e.g., #3) appear immediately in the All Active section without waiting for older puzzles to end
- "Enter" opens the existing Enter modal and proceeds to /solve/<difficulty>/<id> upon success

Scope / Impact
- Frontend-only change; no contract modifications
- Preserves existing UX while removing the discoverability gap

Test
1) Create a new puzzle via contract (create-puzzle)
2) Refresh Home → All Active shows the new puzzle with correct difficulty, pool, players
3) Click Enter → wallet flow → redirected to /solve after confirmation
