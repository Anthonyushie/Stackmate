## Summary

Expand the puzzle database to 60 verified puzzles (20 per difficulty) and add scripts to build/verify from open data sources.

## What’s included

1. `src/data/puzzles.json`
   - 60 puzzles total:
     - 20 Beginner — Mate in 1–2
     - 20 Intermediate — Mate in 2–3
     - 20 Expert — Mate in 3–4
   - Each puzzle includes: `id`, `fen`, `solution` (SAN array), `description`, `difficulty`, `estimatedSolveTime: "30s"`, and `source` metadata (Lichess `PuzzleId` + URL)
   - All verified to be legal and end in checkmate

2. Scripts
   - `scripts/build-puzzles.mjs` — pulls rows from the Lichess chess-puzzles dataset (CC0), filters by `mateInN` themes, converts UCI→SAN, validates with `chess.js`, and writes puzzles.json (20 per difficulty)
   - `scripts/verify-puzzles.mjs` — revalidates the current `puzzles.json` (FEN loads, SAN moves are legal in sequence, final position is checkmate)

## Verification

- Automated verifier output: all 60 puzzles pass (legal sequence, final checkmate)
- Tool: `chess.js` for FEN loading, SAN conversion, and checkmate detection

## Sources & Attribution

- Dataset: Lichess/chess-puzzles (CC0-1.0)
  - https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lichess/chess-puzzles
  - Rows fetched via datasets-server API and filtered by `mate`, `mateIn1..4` themes

## Notes

- Solutions are normalized SAN moves; promotion moves include `=Q` when applicable
- Descriptions note the Lichess puzzle id and mate depth, e.g., “Lichess 001wR: Mate in 3”
- Estimated solve time set to "30s" as requested

## Next steps (optional)

- Add tags (e.g., fork, pin, skewer) from Lichess themes to enrich browsing
- Wire a small UI page to browse puzzles by difficulty and attempt solutions
- Add CI step to run `verify-puzzles.mjs` on PRs
