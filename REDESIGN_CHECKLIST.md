## üéØ RECOMMENDED ORDER OF ATTACK

### Phase 1: Core Game Experience (CRITICAL)
1. **ChessPuzzleSolver.tsx** - Most important component
2. **CountdownTimer.tsx** - Used in SolvePuzzle
3. **LiveLeaderboard.tsx** - Used in SolvePuzzle
4. **SolvePuzzle.tsx** - Core game page (depends on above 3)

**Why this order:** The chess solving experience IS Stackmate. Everything else is secondary. Once users can solve puzzles with the neo-brutal style, the app feels complete.

### Phase 2: Social & Competition
5. **Leaderboard.tsx** - Drives competition and engagement
6. **MyWins.tsx** - User achievement showcase

**Why this order:** After solving works, users want to see rankings and their wins. These pages drive competitive engagement.

### Phase 3: User Profile & Misc
7. **Profile.tsx** - User stats and history
8. **Puzzle.tsx** - Standalone puzzle view

**Why this order:** Nice-to-have pages that show user data. Less critical but complete the experience.

### Phase 4: Polish & Refinement
9. **Skeletons** - All 4 skeleton components
   - ChessBoardSkeleton.tsx
   - LeaderboardSkeleton.tsx
   - ProfileStatsSkeleton.tsx
   - PuzzleCardSkeleton.tsx

10. **Final Polish**
    - [ ] Mobile responsive adjustments
    - [ ] Toast notifications styling (brutal style)
    - [ ] Footer component (if exists)
    - [ ] Error states consistency
    - [ ] Loading states consistency
    - [ ] Accessibility improvements
    - [ ] Performance optimization
    - [ ] Browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
