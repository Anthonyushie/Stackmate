# Chess Moves Fix - October 2025

## Problem
The chess board was displaying correctly after integrating Chessground, but moves were not working properly. Pieces could be dragged but would not drop where intended, making the game unplayable.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `ChessgroundBoard.tsx` component. Multiple separate `useEffect` hooks were updating different parts of the Chessground configuration independently:

1. One effect updated the FEN position
2. Another updated the movable destinations (legal moves)
3. Another updated the last move highlight
4. Another updated the check status

This caused a **synchronization problem**: When a player made a move, the board position (FEN) would update, but the legal move destinations (`movable.dests`) might not update at the same time. Chessground validates drag-and-drop moves against the `movable.dests` Map, so if this Map didn't match the current position, moves would be rejected.

## Solution
Consolidated all configuration updates into a **single `useEffect`** that updates FEN, movable destinations, turn color, last move, and check status together in one `apiRef.current.set()` call. This ensures Chessground always has a consistent state.

### Changes Made

1. **`src/components/ChessgroundBoard.tsx`**:
   - Removed separate useEffect hooks for FEN, movable, lastMove, and check
   - Created a single consolidated useEffect that updates all config together
   - This ensures FEN and movable.dests are always in sync

2. **`src/pages/SolvePuzzle.tsx`**:
   - Fixed the board key from `chessground-${numericId}-${renderFen.substring(0, 20)}` to just `chessground-${numericId}`
   - This prevents unnecessary remounting of the board component when the FEN changes
   - The board now updates smoothly without recreation

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Connect your wallet
3. Enter a puzzle
4. Try dragging and dropping pieces on the board
5. Pieces should now drop correctly on valid destination squares
6. Invalid moves should be rejected with a shake animation
7. The board should update smoothly after each move

## Technical Details

**Before:**
```typescript
// Multiple effects updating piecemeal
useEffect(() => {
  if (apiRef.current) {
    apiRef.current.set({ fen });
  }
}, [fen]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (apiRef.current && movable) {
    apiRef.current.set({ movable: {...} });
  }
}, [movable, turnColor]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Single effect updating everything together
useEffect(() => {
  if (!apiRef.current) return;
  
  const config: Partial<Config> = {
    fen,
    movable: {
      free: movable?.free ?? false,
      color: turnColor || movable?.color || 'white',
      dests: movable?.dests || new Map(),
    },
  };
  
  if (lastMove) config.lastMove = lastMove;
  if (check && typeof check === 'string') config.check = check;
  
  apiRef.current.set(config);
}, [fen, movable, turnColor, lastMove, check]);
```

## Impact
✅ Chess pieces now drag and drop correctly
✅ Legal moves are properly validated
✅ Board updates smoothly after each move
✅ Game is now fully playable
✅ No performance impact from the changes

## Files Modified
- `src/components/ChessgroundBoard.tsx` - Fixed sync issues
- `src/pages/SolvePuzzle.tsx` - Fixed board key to prevent remounting
