## Expected Console Logs

### Good Flow (Success):

```

### Bad Flow (Old Error - Now Fixed):
```
‚ùå Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module doesn't provide an export named: 'makeStandardSTXPostCondition'
```
**Status:** This error is now **FIXED** ‚úÖ

---

## What Was Fixed?

### The Problem
```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD CODE (doesn't work with @stacks/transactions v7)
import { makeStandardSTXPostCondition, FungibleConditionCode } from '@stacks/transactions';

const pc = makeStandardSTXPostCondition(
  senderAddress,
  FungibleConditionCode.Equal,
  entryAmount
);
```

The `makeStandardSTXPostCondition` function was removed in `@stacks/transactions` v7.x

### The Solution
```typescript
// ‚úÖ NEW CODE (works with v7)
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const pc = Pc.principal(senderAddress).willSendEq(entryAmount).ustx();
```

This creates the same post condition using the new fluent `Pc` builder API:
- `Pc.principal(address)` - sets the principal address
- `.willSendEq(amount)` - sets condition to "equal" with amount
- `.ustx()` - specifies micro-STX tokens

**Result:**
```json
{
  "type": "stx-postcondition",
  "address": "ST2QK4128H22NH4H8MD2AVP72M0Q72TKS48VB5469",
  "condition": "eq",
  "amount": "1000000"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No wallet provider available"
- Install Leather/Xverse/Hiro wallet extension
- Refresh page after installation

### "No sender address"
- Ensure wallet is on **Testnet** (not mainnet)
- Disconnect and reconnect wallet
- Check wallet has an active account

### "Insufficient STX balance"
- Get testnet STX from faucet
- Wait for faucet transaction to confirm (~30-60 seconds)

### "Transaction stuck in pending"
- Testnet can be slow, wait up to 2 minutes
- Check transaction on explorer: https://explorer.hiro.so/testnet

### Wallet popup doesn't open
- Check browser popup blocker
- Ensure wallet extension is unlocked
- Try refreshing page and reconnecting

## Files Changed

### `/src/lib/contracts.ts`
- Line 1: Import changed to use `Pc` instead of `makeStandardSTXPostCondition`
- Line 175: Post condition creation updated to new API

### Test Files Created
- `scripts/test-post-conditions.mjs` - Automated verification script
- `.env.local` - Environment configuration
- `WALLET_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md` - This file

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm wallet connection and puzzle entry work:

1. ‚úÖ **Test Puzzle Solving**
   - Submit a solution after entering
   - Verify leaderboard updates

2. ‚úÖ **Test Prize Claiming**
   - Win a puzzle (or simulate with contract)
   - Claim prize as winner

3. ‚úÖ **Test Edge Cases**
   - Try entering twice (should be blocked)
   - Test with insufficient balance
   - Test user cancellation

4. ‚úÖ **Cross-Wallet Testing**
   - Test with Xverse wallet
   - Test with Hiro wallet
   - Verify all work the same

5. ‚úÖ **Deploy to Production**
   - Test on mainnet (with real STX!)
   - Update contract addresses in `.env.local`
