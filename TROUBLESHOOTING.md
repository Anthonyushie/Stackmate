# üîß Troubleshooting: Frontend Not Showing Puzzles

## Issue
You successfully called `create-puzzle` on the contract, but the frontend doesn't show any puzzles.

## Root Causes & Solutions

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration ‚ùå (MOST COMMON)

**Problem:** The frontend doesn't know which contract to query.

**Solution:** Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env
VITE_CONTRACT_TESTNET=ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.puzzle-pool
VITE_CONTRACT_MAINNET=SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78.puzzle-pool
```

Replace `ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM` with **your actual deployed contract address**.

**After creating `.env`, restart your dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun run dev
```

### 2. Difficulty Stakes Not Initialized ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** The contract requires difficulty stakes to be set before creating puzzles.

Looking at line 127-130 in `puzzle-pool.clar`:
```clarity
(stake-amount (get-stake-for-difficulty difficulty))
...
(asserts! (> stake-amount u0) err-invalid-difficulty)
```

**Solution:** Initialize stakes in your contract using the contract owner wallet:

```clarity
;; Call these functions from Stacks Explorer or your wallet:
(contract-call? .puzzle-pool set-difficulty-stake "beginner" u500000)      ;; 0.5 STX
(contract-call? .puzzle-pool set-difficulty-stake "intermediate" u2000000) ;; 2 STX  
(contract-call? .puzzle-pool set-difficulty-stake "expert" u5000000)       ;; 5 STX
```

**Where to call these:**
- Stacks Explorer: https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/contract-call/
- Hiro Wallet: Contract Call tab
- Leather Wallet: Contract Interaction

### 3. Puzzle Not Actually Active üîç

**Problem:** The puzzle was created but isn't marked as active.

**Check:** Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
cd /project/workspace/Anthonyushie/Stackmate
VITE_CONTRACT_TESTNET=<your-address>.puzzle-pool node scripts/test-contract.mjs
```

This will show:
- Total puzzles created
- Which puzzles are active
- Full details of each puzzle

---

### 4. Network Mismatch üåê

**Problem:** Your wallet is on testnet but contract is on mainnet (or vice versa).

**Solution:** Ensure your wallet network matches the contract deployment:
- Testnet contracts start with `ST`
- Mainnet contracts start with `SP`

Check your wallet network in the Hiro/Leather wallet settings.

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

Run through these steps:

- [ ] **Step 1:** Create `.env` file with correct contract address
- [ ] **Step 2:** Restart dev server (`npm run dev` or `bun run dev`)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Run diagnostic: `node scripts/test-contract.mjs`
- [ ] **Step 4:** Verify difficulty stakes are initialized
- [ ] **Step 5:** Check wallet is on correct network (testnet vs mainnet)
- [ ] **Step 6:** Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- [ ] **Step 7:** Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## Testing the Connection

### Manual Test in Browser Console:

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
const contract = import.meta.env.VITE_CONTRACT_TESTNET;
console.log('Contract configured:', contract);

// If undefined or error, .env is not loaded properly
```

### Using the Diagnostic Script:

```bash
# From project root
VITE_CONTRACT_TESTNET=ST1234567890.puzzle-pool node scripts/test-contract.mjs
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Total puzzles created: 3
‚úÖ Puzzle 1 is ACTIVE
‚úÖ Puzzle 2 is ACTIVE
‚úÖ Found 2 active puzzle(s)
```

---

## Expected Frontend Behavior

Once configured correctly:

1. **Home page** should show 3 puzzle cards (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
2. **Each card** should show:
   - Entry fee (0.5, 2, or 5 STX)
   - Prize pool (accumulated from entries)
   - Number of players
   - Time remaining (countdown)
3. **"Enter Puzzle"** button should be clickable

## Still Having Issues?

Check the browser console for specific errors:

### Common Errors:

**Error:** `Missing contract id env var`
- **Fix:** Create `.env` file with contract addresses

**Error:** `Puzzle not found` or `err-not-found`
- **Fix:** Initialize difficulty stakes first

**Error:** `Network request failed`
- **Fix:** Check internet connection and Stacks API status

**Error:** Contract calls timeout
- **Fix:** Try switching Stacks API endpoint or wait for network to stabilize

## Contract Owner Checklist

Before puzzles will work, you must:

1. ‚úÖ Deploy `puzzle-pool.clar` contract
2. ‚úÖ Initialize difficulty stakes (3 transactions)
3. ‚úÖ Create at least one puzzle with `create-puzzle`
4. ‚úÖ Configure frontend `.env` with deployed address
5. ‚úÖ Restart dev server

---

## Need More Help?

1. Run the diagnostic script and share the output
2. Check browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) for errors
3. Verify your contract address on Stacks Explorer
4. Ensure you're using the correct network (testnet/mainnet)
