# ðŸ”¥ Wallet Connect Testing Guide

## Quick Start

Your dev server is running at: **http://localhost:5173/**

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install a Stacks Wallet Extension

You need ONE of these browser extensions:

#### **Hiro Wallet** (Recommended for beginners)
- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hiro-wallet/ldinpeekobnhjjdofggfgjlcehhmanlj
- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hiro-wallet/

#### **Xverse Wallet**
- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xverse-wallet/idnnbdplmphpflfnlkomgpfbpcgelopg

#### **Leather Wallet** (formerly Hiro Wallet)
- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leather/ldinpeekobnhjjdofggfgjlcehhmanlj

### 2. Set Up Your Wallet
1. Install the extension
2. Create a new wallet OR import an existing one
3. Save your seed phrase securely (NEVER share it!)
4. Choose a password

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Open the App
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/ in your browser
2. You should see the Stackmate header with a yellow "Connect Wallet" button

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
1. Click the **"Connect Wallet"** button
2. A pink dropdown will appear with wallet options (Hiro, Xverse, Leather)
3. Click your installed wallet
4. Your wallet extension popup will open
5. **Review the connection request** and click "Connect" or "Approve"

### Step 3: Verify Connection
Once connected, you should see:
- âœ… Your truncated Stacks address (e.g., `ST1ABC...XYZ9`)
- âœ… Your STX balance (may show 0.000000 if no funds)
- âœ… Current network (testnet by default)
- âœ… Connected wallet name

### Step 4: Test Features

#### **View Wallet Details**
- Click the connected wallet button (shows your address + balance)
- A dropdown menu will appear with:
  - Your full address and balance
  - "Copy address" button
  - "Disconnect" button
  - Network toggle (Testnet/Mainnet)
  - "View on explorer" link

#### **Copy Address**
1. Click "Copy address" in the dropdown
2. Paste somewhere to verify it copied correctly

#### **Switch Networks**
1. Click either "Testnet" or "Mainnet" in the dropdown
2. Your balance will refresh for the selected network
3. The active network has a black ring around it

#### **View on Explorer**
1. Click "View on explorer"
2. Opens Hiro Explorer in a new tab showing your address

#### **Disconnect**
1. Click "Disconnect"
2. Wallet should disconnect
3. Button returns to "Connect Wallet" state

### Step 5: Test Reconnection
1. Refresh the page
2. The wallet should auto-detect your previous connection
3. Click "Connect Wallet" again to reconnect

## Getting Testnet STX

To test with actual balance:

1. **Switch to Testnet** (if not already)
2. **Copy your address** from the wallet
3. **Get testnet STX** from the faucet:
   - https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet
   - Paste your address
   - Click "Request STX"
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for the transaction to confirm
5. **Refresh** the page or click the wallet button to see updated balance

## Troubleshooting

### "No wallet detected" or connection fails
- âœ… Make sure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
- âœ… Refresh the page
- âœ… Try a different browser or incognito mode
- âœ… Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console)

### Balance shows "â€”" or "0"
- âœ… You might not have any STX on that network
- âœ… Try switching networks (testnet â†” mainnet)
- âœ… Request testnet STX from the faucet (see above)
- âœ… Wait a few seconds, balance fetches in background

### Network switch doesn't update balance
- âœ… Click the wallet button again to refresh
- âœ… Check browser console for API errors
- âœ… Hiro API might be slow, wait 10-20 seconds

### Button shows "Connectingâ€¦" forever
- âœ… Check if wallet popup was blocked by your browser
- âœ… Refresh the page and try again
- âœ… Make sure wallet extension is unlocked

### Wallet provider not listed
- âœ… Only Hiro, Xverse, and Leather are currently supported
- âœ… Make sure the wallet supports `@stacks/connect`

## What's Being Tested

### âœ… Wallet Connection (`@stacks/connect`)
- Multi-wallet provider selection
- Connection flow via wallet popup
- Address resolution from provider

### âœ… Network Configuration
- Testnet (default)
- Mainnet
- API base URLs from `src/lib/stacks.ts`

### âœ… State Management (Zustand)
- `useWallet` hook in `src/hooks/useWallet.ts`
- Persistent wallet state across component rerenders

### âœ… Balance Fetching
- Real-time STX balance from Hiro API
- `fetchStxBalance()` in `src/lib/stacks.ts`
- Micro-STX â†’ STX conversion

### âœ… UI/UX (Neo-Brutalist)
- Framer Motion animations
- TailwindCSS styling
- Provider dropdown
- Connected state dropdown
- Loading states

## Next Steps

Once everything works:
1. âœ… Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave)
2. âœ… Test with different wallets (Hiro, Xverse, Leather)
3. âœ… Test network switching multiple times
4. âœ… Test disconnect â†’ reconnect flow
5. âœ… Test with mainnet wallet (use with caution, real STX!)

## Developer Notes

### Inspecting State
Open browser console and run:
```js
// Check if wallet provider is available
window.HiroWalletProvider || window.XverseProviders || window.LeatherProvider

// Check @stacks/connect
window.StacksProvider
```

### Check Network Requests
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "balances"
4. You should see requests to `api.testnet.hiro.so` or `api.hiro.so`

### Debugging Wallet Issues
Check the console for:
- `@stacks/connect` logs
- Provider errors
- API fetch errors
- Zustand state updates
